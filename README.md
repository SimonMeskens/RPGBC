Everyone knows that the best game is one that's made by blindly listening to fan input.

Basically, feel free to suggest the next feature for this game and vote for the features you'd like to see. Whenever I have time and feel like it, I'll add the top voted feature. In the future, it'll be open-sourced (vote for it!), so other programmers can start adding features, because the game will become even better if lots of people work on it!

# The rules:
* The game will be an RPG
* The playing field consists of one row of Unicode characters
* There's a GUI bar
* There's a bar displaying the controls
* You can't change any of the above
* You can change colors though
* I will interpret your idea as I see fit

Right now, the game doesn't even have a name! Suggest one!
